ABOUT:
===============================
Orchestral _scores_ typically place pairs of like parts on the same stove
(both flute 1 and 2, for example).
Orchestral _parts_ however are provided separately for those two flute players.
While proprietary software handles this dual layout,
open source libraries do not.
Music21, for example, has a `voicesToPart` function
specifically for splitting two voices within a measure,
but this is only a small part of the consideration.
This module handles a wider set of considerations.

For details of included vs not included functionality, see `split_part`.

    """
    This script creates a duplicate part
    and then filters the part and the duplicate to remove double voices and chords.
    The first part retains the top voice and top note of a chord,
    the second part retains lowest voice and lowest note in any chords.
    This should provide part of the solution with no new errors added.

    Text such as `solo`, `a1`, and `a2` and similar markings which are encoded only as text
    are simply reproduced and not processed.
    This may change in the future (e.g., excluding `a1` parts from the second voice).
    Then again, it's arguably better to err on the side of too much.
    It's quite easy to verify and delete passages marked "a1" manually,
    and much more difficulty to notice that something absent is missing.

    3+ parts on the same stave are not handled.
    It is rare (and arguably 'wrong') to do this on wind parts.
    As such, any third middle voice that is encoded is ignored/removed.

    A note to those looking at how this works in practice:
    music21 counts
    _pitches from the bottom up_ and
    _voices from the top down_.

    @param p: The input part.
    @return: The two output parts, combined in a list.
